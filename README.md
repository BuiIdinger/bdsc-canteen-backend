# Canteen Backend

AS 91896-897 Programming and Processes Assessment.

# Building

You don't have to build in order to test out the app, vist [here](https://buildinger.org/projects/canteen). If you want to build from source, then its impossible as I dont publicly release BWSS which is the WebSocket library I use.

# Dependencies

- [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) BWSS uses this for SSL.
- [BWSS](https://buildinger.org/) WebSocket.
- [Cassandra library](https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver/) Used for connecting to database cluster.
- [Boost JSON](https://github.com/boostorg/json) Parsing JSON data.

# Documentation

Design choices, programs used for this whole assessment is available at [here](https://buildinger.org/projects/canteen/documentation.pdf).
